# Snake Game using Pygame
This is a classic Snake game built with Pygame, a cross-platform set of Python modules designed for writing video games. In this game, the player controls a snake, which grows in length as it eats fruits. The objective of the game is to eat as many fruits as possible without hitting the walls or the snake's body.

# How to play
1. Install Pygame using the command "pip install pygame" in your command prompt or terminal.

2. Download the code and save it in your preferred location.

3. Open the command prompt or terminal and navigate to the directory where the code is saved.

4. Run the command "python main.py" to start the game.

5. Use the arrow keys on your keyboard to move the snake in the desired direction.

6. Eat the fruits that appear on the screen to grow the snake.

7. The game ends if the snake hits the walls or its own body.

8. Press the "Enter" key to play again after the game ends.
